Additional notes for the two population analysis figures:

"homo_sapiens_mask_3rep_anc_tdiv.pdf" is created by src/plot_homsap_two_pop.R. The final figure "homo_sapiens_two_pop_comp.pdf" is a composite of that plus cartoons of the simulated and inferred demographic models.

"dromel_3mb_no_mask_3rep_anc_tdiv.pdf" is created by src/plot_dromel_two_pop.R. The final figure "d_mel_two_popn_comp.pdf" is a composite of that and cartoons of the simulated and inferred demographic models.
